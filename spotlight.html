            <h2>Top Artist Spotlight: ENHYPEN</h2>
            <p>
                I became a fan of ENHYPEN in 2023, and have never stopped listening to their music since. They continue to shape my music taste with their incredible storytelling, polished discography, and breathtaking performances. I saw them in concert in 2024 and 2025, and plan to attend many more performances.
